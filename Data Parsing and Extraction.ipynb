    "1. **Data Extraction**: Extracting data from contracts (structured and unstructured).\n",
    "2. **Structure Recognition**: Understanding the structure of documents and identifying relevant sections.\n",
    "3. **Data Standardization**: Converting extracted data into a consistent format.\n",
    "4. **Contextual Understanding**: Interpreting complex clauses and conditions in contracts.\n",
    "5. **Anomaly Detection**: Identifying unusual terms or discrepancies in documents.\n",
    "6. **HTML Parsing**: Gen AI can analyze HTML structure and extract relevant information.\n",
    "7. **Natural Language Understanding**: It can interpret and extract data from unstructured text.\n",
    "8. **Data Cleaning**: Gen AI can clean and format extracted data.\n",
    "9. **Adaptive Scraping**: It can adjust to different website layouts and structures.\n",
    "10. **Data Transformation**: Gen AI can convert extracted data into structured formats like JSON or CSV.\n",

    "### Key Terminology:\n",
    "- **Document Parsing**: The process of extracting structured information from unstructured or semi-structured documents.\n",
    "- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identifying and classifying key information in text into predefined categories.\n",
    "- **Information Extraction**: The task of automatically extracting structured information from unstructured or semi-structured documents.\n",
    "- **Entity**: A real-world object, such as a person, location, or organization, mentioned in text.\n",
    "- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: The process of identifying and classifying named entities in text.\n",
    "- **Unstructured Data**: Data that doesn't have a predefined data model or organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a data engineer, this capability is invaluable as it automates the tedious process of manual data entry and standardization, allowing for quicker analysis and insights generation."
